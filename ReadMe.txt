Data are categorized into four folders.

(a) Instances & Results related to S/N Ratio:

this folder includes four instances corresponding to the experiment related to Figure 4, and their results. 

(b) Selected Three Instances: 
this folder includes the raw information of Case NB, WB, and MB. Each of them consists of four sheets, including the information of products, materials, cutting norms, and output rates.

(c) Similarity Comparison: 
this folder consists of the computational results corresponding to Section 8.3. Each XLS. Document consists of 2 sheets. The first sheet shows the selection of plats under CAMLB and CAMUB. The second one shows the number of selected boards in different types. So that readers can calculate the similarity.

(d) Algorithm Performance: 
each XLS. Document consists of (1) the splicing plan, (2) transformed demand, (3) long strips produced under each configuration, and the corresponding satisfaction structure, inventory level, (4) results under different configurations.
