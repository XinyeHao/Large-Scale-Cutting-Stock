Hello,

Here are the codes and data of our paper "Solving a real-world cutting-stock problem: a clustering-assignment-based model" published on IISE-Transactions.

You can use the Java project and the input data to reproduce the results in our paper (under the same experiment environment).

If you have any question, do not hesitate to contact haoxinye_ie@163.com.

Sincerely,

Xinye HAO
